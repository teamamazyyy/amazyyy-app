# Contributing to Amazyyy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Amazyyy! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history and helps with automated versioning and changelog generation.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

#### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

#### Scope
The scope should be the name of the module affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

#### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

#### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense. The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

#### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
